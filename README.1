DOCUMENTATION:

Examine the dmalloc.info file.  Is is a gnu-info file having the
user-documentation for the dmalloc subsystem.  It can be installed in
the emacs info directory and read with emacs/info or the info program
available from the texinfo package at GNU archive sites.  It is also
suitable for reading as text.

It can be reproduced from the dmalloc.texi texinfo file which also can
generate TeX hardcopy output with the help of the texinfo.tex file.
It is available online at URL: http://www.letters.com/~gray/dmalloc.

A dmalloc.ps postscript file may also have been included for you
TeX-less folks.

ARGV LIBRARY:

My argv library should have been included with this package
(argv.[ch], argv_loc.h).  I use it with all my binaries.  It functions
similar to the getopt routines in that it provides a standardized way
of processing arguments.  However, that is where the similarity ends.
You have to write no C code to do the actual processing, it handles
short -l and long --logfile style options, gives standard short and
long usage messages, and many other features while trying to comply
with POSIX specs.

For copies of the library, ftp to ftp.letters.com and look in the
/src/argv directory.

THANKS:

Many net folk contributed to the library and my thanks goes out to
them all.

However, special thanks must go to my core contributors/testers: Scott
Michel, Greg Sylvain, Bali Jatinder, Marc Evans, Dave Hill, Manfred
Hauswirth, Richard Birnbaum, Francois Pinard, Irv Lustig, Marty
Leisner, and Rik Faith.
