INSTALLATION:

1) Run 'sh ./configure' to configure the library and generate the
	Makefile and conf.h.  Examine conf.h (especially) as well as
	Makefile to make sure configure set things up correctly.

2) Typing 'make' should be enough to build libmalloc.a and
	malloc_dbg program.

3) Typing 'make test' should build the malloc_t test program

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOCUMENTATION:

Examine the malloc.info file.  Is is a gnu-info file having the
user-documentation for the malloc subsystem.  It can be installed in
the emacs info directory and read with emacs/info or the info program
available at GNU archive sites.  It is also suitable for reading as
text.

It can be reproduced from the malloc.texi texinfo file which also can
generate TeX hardcopy output.  You may need the new texinfo.tex from
the gnu archive sites.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:

- the system is definitely dependent on a good ansi-c compiler like gcc.
- the file Manifest contains a list of each of the file and what it does.
- configure can be regenerated by the autoconf script.
- the file sample.c contains an example of some of the malloc macros and
	functions.
