DOCUMENTATION:

Examine the dmalloc.html file which contains the user-documentation
for the dmalloc subsystem.  There also is an dmalloc.info file which
can be installed in the emacs info directory and read with emacs/info
or the info program available from the texinfo package at GNU archive
sites.  It is also suitable for reading as text.  The source of all
documation is the dmalloc.texi texinfo file which also can generate
postscript or TeX hardcopy output with the help of the texinfo.tex
file.  You can download the full documentation package or read it
online from the repository.

ARGV LIBRARY:

My argv library should have been included with this package
(argv.[ch], argv_loc.h).  I use it with all my binaries.  It functions
similar to the getopt routines in that it provides a standardized way
of processing arguments.  However, that is where the similarity ends.
You have to write no C code to do the actual processing, it handles
short -l and long --logfile style options, gives standard short and
long usage messages, and many other features while trying to comply
with POSIX specs.

For copies of the library, ftp to ftp.256.com and look in the
/src/argv directory.

THANKS:

Many net folk contributed to the design, development, and overall
library and my thanks goes out to them all.
