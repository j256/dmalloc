The following set of tasks should be performed when the dmalloc
library gets released.

1) Update the version number in version.h and where else it lists.
2) Update the ChangeLog and NEWS files.
3) Update the RELEASE.html file.
4) Check in all files.
5) cvs tag the release with dmalloc_release_X_X_X
6) make distclean ; autoconf ; configure ; make release

7) Copy down to OpenBSD, Linux, OSF, FreeBSD, other operation systems
and run tests.

	- [ maybe mkdir x ; cd x ]
	- ./configure or ../configure
	- make all heavy
	- maybe install the new dmalloc utility to test
	- dmalloc -l malloc high
	- make heavy
	- examine the log file, check version, look for exceptions
	- [ maybe dmalloc_t -r ] to check for wierd flag conditions

8) md5 the tarball and adjust the various version and distinfo files
   in the ports/ subdirectory.

9) Install the tgz file and html file in the repository
10) Ftp the new version files over to upload.sourceforge.net/incoming
11) Edit releases/index.html to include the new version
12) Copy the .tgz file to /usr/ports/distfiles

13) Update the /usr/ports/devel/dmalloc directory files from the
    ports/ subdir, and run 'make package'.  Install the package.

14) Copy to OpenBSD and build the package.

	1) cd /usr/ports/devel/dmalloc
	2) make clean
	3) Update Makefile from repository.
	4) make (make sure it can pull it from the online repository)
	5) make deinstall (maybe need to do a pkg_delete dmalloc-X.X.X)
	6) make reinstall
	7) make plist
	8) Compare pkg/PLIST with pkg/PLIST-auto
	9) make package
	10) try a pkg_add and pkg_delete on the package
	11) make clean
	12) tar up the /usr/ports/devel/dmalloc directory
	13) Copy the resulting tarball to the repository as -ports.tgz

15) Copy to Linux and build the RPM.

	1) Update the dmalloc.spec file
        2) cp dmalloc-X.X.X.tgz /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/
	3) rpm -ba dmalloc.spec
	4) Try to rpm -U dmalloc-X.X.X-1.i386.rpm
	5) Copy the resulting RPM and SRPM to the repository
		/usr/src/redhat/SRPMS/dmalloc-X.X.X-1.src.rpm
		/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/dmalloc-X.X.X-1.i386.rpm

16) Possibly announce on freshmeat
17) Announce on egroups.
