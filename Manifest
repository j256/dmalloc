Description of the files in the malloc package.

COPYING-LIB		The famous GNU Library Public License.

Changelog		Change log entries detailing major module
			changes.

Makefile.in		Used by configure to create the Makefile.

Manifest		This file.

NOTES			General Notes of the malloc routines and
			associated algorithms.

README			Quick startup notes.

TTD			Things To Do list.  It only gets longer and
			longer.

chunk.[ch]		Lower level allocation routines.  This is the
			meat of the allocation algorithms.  Manages
			and debugs the administration structures of
			the heap.  Too large!

chunk_loc.h		Local defines specific to the chunk routines
			only.

compat.[ch]		System compatibility routines if missing
			functionality.

conf.h.in		Used by configure to create the conf.h
			configurations.

configure		Configure script.

configure.in		Used by autoconf to create the configure
			script.

dbg_tokens.h		Tokens that correspond to debugging
			functionality.

dbg_values.h		Values corresponding to the debug tokens.

error.[ch]		Debugging routines and others that provide
			user output.

error_str.h		Strings that correspond to malloc error codes.

error_val.h		General error codes for the malloc module.

heap.[ch]		Possibly machine specific routines for
			allocating space on and manipulating the heap.

malloc.[ch]		Higher level alloc routines including malloc,
			free, realloc, etc.  These are the routines to
			be called from user space.

malloc.info		User-level gnu info manual file for the malloc
			routines.  Suitable as a text manual also.

malloc.texi		Texinfo user manual for generating TeX or Info
			formats.  This is not distributed normally to
			conserve space.  Let me know if you want a
			copy.

malloc_dbg.c		Program that assists in the setting of the
			MALLOC_DEBUG and other debug environmental
			variables.

malloc_loc.h		Local defines for all of the malloc routines.

malloc_lp.[ch]		Leap-frog routines to provide file/line info
			to lib.

malloc_str.[ch]		Malloc string routines for string testing.

malloc_t.c		Meager test program for testing the malloc
			routines.

mallocrc		Sample RC file that is used to set the debug
			flags.

sample.c		A sample file to demonstrate the usage of the
			library.

version.h		Version number for the library.
