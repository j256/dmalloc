Description of the files in the malloc package.

Changelog		Change log entries detailing major module
			changes.

Makefile.in		Used by configure to create the Makefile.

Manifest		This file.

NEWS			File with a condenced view of the module's
			ChangeLog entries.

NOTES			General Notes of the malloc routines and
			associated algorithms.

README			Quick startup notes.

TODO			Things to do list.  It only gets longer and
			longer.

arg_check.[ch]		Malloc routines used for testing of arguments.

argv/			Argument library sub-directory.

chunk.[ch]		Lower level allocation routines.  This is the
			meat of the allocation algorithms.  Manages
			and debugs the administration structures of
			the heap.  Too large!

chunk_loc.h		Local defines specific to the chunk routines
			only.

compat.[ch]		System compatibility routines if missing
			functionality.

conf.h			Configure defines produced by configure.

conf.h.in		Used by configure to create the conf.h
			configurations.

configure		Configure script.

configure.in		Used by autoconf to create the configure
			script.

const.h			Small header file to be included in malloc_dbg.h.

const.h.in		Used by configure to create the const.h stuff.

contrib/		directory of contributions from other sources

dbg_tokens.h		Tokens that correspond to debugging
			functionality.

dbg_values.h		Values corresponding to the debug tokens.

error.[ch]		Debugging routines and others that provide
			user output.

error_str.h		Strings that correspond to malloc error codes.

error_val.h		General error codes for the malloc module.

heap.[ch]		Possibly machine specific routines for
			allocating space on and manipulating the heap.

malloc.c		Higher level alloc routines including malloc,
			free, realloc, etc.  These are the routines to
			be called from user space.

malloc.info		User-level gnu info manual file for the malloc
			routines.  Suitable as a text manual also.

malloc.ps		Possible postcript file for TeX-less folks.

malloc.texi		Texinfo user manual for generating TeX or Info
			formats.

malloc_dbg.[12]		Used to create malloc_dbg.h.

malloc_dbg.c		Program that assists in the setting of the
			MALLOC_DEBUG and other debug environmental
			variables.

malloc_dbg.h		Installed malloc .h file to be included in
			those .c files where file and line debugging
			information is required.

malloc_loc.h		Local defines for all of the malloc routines.

malloc_lp.[ch]		Leap-frog routines to provide file/line info
			to lib.

malloc_t.c		Meager test program for testing the malloc
			routines.

mallocrc		Sample RC file that is used to set the debug
			flags.

return.h		Defines to get the return-address for non-malloc calls.

texinfo.tex		File included to allow tex output from the
			malloc.texi file.

version.h		Version number for the library.
