Description of the files in the malloc package.

Changelog		Log entries detailing major module changes.

Deansify.pl		Perl script to attempt to convert the code to
			non-ansi format. (yeaauuck!)

INSTALL			Installation guide.

Makefile.in		Used by configure to create the Makefile.

Manifest		This file.

NEWS			File with a condensed view of the module's
			ChangeLog entries per version.

NOTES			General Notes of the malloc routines and
			associated algorithms.

README			Quick startup notes.

TODO			Things to do list.  It gets longer and longer.

arg_check.[ch]		Malloc routines used for testing of arguments.

argv.[ch]		Argument processing library files.

argv_loc.h		Local defines for the argv files.

chunk.[ch]		Lower level allocation routines.  This is the
			meat of the allocation algorithms.  Manages
			and debugs the administration structures of
			the heap.  Too large!

chunk_loc.h		Local defines specific to the chunk routines
			only.

compat.[ch]		System compatibility routines if missing
			functionality.

conf.h			File of library defines produced by configure.

conf.h.in		Used by configure to create the conf.h file.

config.help		Help file about the GNU configure scripts.

configure		Configure shell script.

configure.in		Used by autoconf to create configure script.

contrib/		directory of contributions from other sources

debug_tok.h		Tokens that correspond to debugging
			functionality.

debug_val.h		Values corresponding to the debug tokens.

dmalloc.c		Program that assists in the setting of the
			DMALLOC_DEBUG and other debug environmental
			variables.

dmalloc.h		Installed malloc .h file to be included in
			those .c files where file and line debugging
			information is required.

dmalloc.h.[123]		Used to create dmalloc.h.

dmalloc.info		User-level gnu info manual file for the malloc
			routines.  Suitable as a text manual also.

dmalloc.ps		Possible postscript file for TeX-less folks.

dmalloc.texi		Texinfo user manual for generating TeX or Info
			formats.

dmalloc_loc.h		Local defines for all of the malloc routines.

dmalloc_lp.[ch]		Leap-frog routines to provide file/line info
			to lib.

dmalloc_t.c		Meager test program for testing the malloc
			routines.

dmallocrc		Sample RC file that is used to set the debug
			flags.

error.[ch]		Debugging routines and others that provide
			user output.

error_str.h		Strings that correspond to malloc error codes.

error_val.h		General error codes for the malloc module.

heap.[ch]		Possibly machine specific routines for
			allocating space on and manipulating the heap.

malloc.c		Higher level alloc routines including malloc,
			free, realloc, etc.  These are the routines to
			be called from user space.

return.h		Defines to get the return-address for non-malloc calls.

texinfo.tex		File included to allow tex output from the
			malloc.texi file.

version.h		Version number for the library.
