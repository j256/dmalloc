Version 2.1.1:

	* Marty Leisner <leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com> compiles library on MS-DOG!
	* Fixed some problems with malloc_errno set after call to error.

Version 2.1.0:

	* Fixed problem with never-reuse going on/off and check-lists.
	* Added -r (random-debug) option to malloc_t.
	* Fixed nasty bug in realloc with alloc-blank + no realloc-copy token.
	* Fixed problem with ANSI-C configure on AIX systems.
	* Fixed some race conditions with sbrk failure.
	* Added -p max-pointers argument to malloc_t.
	* Added 'log-nonfree-space' token for logging unfreed memory space.
	* Added iteration count lable to all logfile output.  See conf.h.
	* Added xmalloc,xrealloc,etc. override functions.
	* Added better mechanisms for const definition.
	* Lots of install, notes, misc. changes from net feedback.
	* Renamed token 'log-perror' and 'print-perror' to '...-error'.

Version 2.0.1:

	* Cleaned up a number of configure/compat functions.
	* Fixed tons of __STDC__ defines.  Finally I hope.
	* Added more commands to malloc_t to log information, etc.

Version 2.0.0:

	* Lots of changes to add argv files in place of argv subdir.
	* Added initial support for external block locating.
	* Added 'allow-nonlinear' token to remove special checks.
	* Renamed dbg_tokens.h -> debug_tok.h and dbg_values.h -> debug_val.h
	* Added -V option to malloc_dbg and desc field for debug-token list.
	* Added a debugging section to the manual.
	* Added light and heavy makefile targets for automatic testing.
	* Much improved heap code with per-block allocations (not base 2).
	* Better free list management with block splitting.

Version 1.3.6:

	* Fixed some compilation errors with non-STDC systems.

Version 1.3.5:

	* More automatic and comprehensive malloc_t testing facilities.
	* Added -T (list-tokens) to malloc_dbg: for listing of debug tokens.
	* Added 'never-reuse' token to never reuse free'd memory.
	* Added on_exit and atexit support to auto-call malloc_shutdown.
	* Added hooks to all malloc utility functions to malloc_lp.o.
	* removed debug token log-ra since log-unknown should be enough.
	* malloc_heap_map() -> malloc_log_heap_map() for consistency.
	* Added malloc_log_unfreed() to dump non-free memory to logfile.
	* Added -m (minus) option to malloc_dbg to allow removing of tokens.
	* Added -p flag to malloc_dbg to allow adding of tokens to debug value.
	* added DEBUG_LOG_STAMP to add timestamps to log entries.
	* Added malloc_log_stats() to dump stats to a file.
	* Re-added cfree() call.  No reason not to have it.

Version 1.3.4:

	* Fixed compat function problems, added checks for -std1 cc flags.
	* Fixed debug messages to reflect reality.
	* Added malloc_debug_current and changed #if __STDC__ -> #ifdef

	* Added some C++ from Peter Miller to the manual.
	* Removed LGPL and replaced it with fully free software notices.
	* _malloc_perror renamed to _malloc_error
	* Made malloc_address exported so it can be setable by debugger.
