Version 2.0.0:

	* Renamed dbg_tokens.h -> debug_tok.h and dbg_values.h -> debug_val.h
	* Added -V option to malloc_dbg and desc field for debug-token list.
	* Added a debugging section to the manual.
	* Added light and heavy makefile targets for automatic testing.
	* Much improved heap code with per-block allocations (not base 2).
	* Better free list management with block splitting.

Version 1.3.6:

	* Fixed some compilation errors with non-STDC systems.

Version 1.3.5:

	* More automatic and comprehensive malloc_t testing facilities.
	* Added -T (list-tokens) to malloc_dbg: for listing of debug tokens.
	* Added 'never-reuse' token to never reuse free'd memory.
	* Added on_exit and atexit support to auto-call malloc_shutdown.
	* Added hooks to all malloc utility functions to malloc_lp.o.
	* removed debug token log-ra since log-unknown should be enough.
	* malloc_heap_map() -> malloc_log_heap_map() for consistancy.
	* Added malloc_log_unfreed() to dump non-free memory to logfile.
	* Added -m (minus) option to malloc_dbg to allow removing of tokens.
	* Added -p flag to malloc_dbg to allow adding of tokens to debug value.
	* added DEBUG_LOG_STAMP to add timestamps to log entries.
	* Added malloc_log_stats() to dump stats to a file.
	* Re-added cfree() call.  No reason not to have it.

Version 1.3.4:

	* Fixed compat function problems, added checks for -std1 cc flags.
	* Fixed debug messages to reflect reality.
	* Added malloc_debug_current and changed #if __STDC__ -> #ifdef

	* added free's file/line to log_bad_pnt messages.
	* Renamed all error codes to ERROR_*.

	* Removed MALLOC_TRACE and -t, replaced with MALLOC_ADDRESS:0.
	* Fixed some const problems.
	* Added ability of MALLOC_LOGFILE.%d for getpid

Version 1.3.1:

	* Added 'log-ra' token to log info on non-freed return-address memory
	* Added the beginnings of return-address handling
	* Added -L or --list to malloc_dbg to list all the rc-file tags.

Version 1.3.0:

	* Added MALLOC_TRACE variable and malloc_dbg -t (NOTE: later removed)
	* Added some C++ from Peter Miller to the manual.
	* Removed LGPL and replaced it with fully free software notices.
	* _malloc_perror renamed to _malloc_error
	* Made malloc_address exported so it can be setable by debugger.
	* Added auto-sensing of shell by malloc_dbg and -C option.
	* Removed the dblock checking tokens CHECK_DBLOCK and CHECK_DB_FENCE.

Version 1.2.6:

	* Added 'catch-null' token for quiting as soon as we get sbrk failure.

Version 1.2.5:
