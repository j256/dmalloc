 * 14 (meaning basic block size of 16k) will probably be good.
 *
 * NOTE: some sbrk functions round to the correct page-size.  If this
 * value is too low, the dmalloc library may think someone is using
 * sbrk behind its back and return a ERROR_ALLOC_NONLINEAR error
 * (#18).  No problems aside from a possible small increase in the
 * administration overhead should happen if this value is too high.

 *
 * NOTE: the value will never be auto-configured to be less than 8
 * because some system (like sparc for instance) report the sizeof(long)
 * == 4 while the register size is 8 bytes.  Certain memory needs to be of
 * the same base as the register size (stack frames, code, etc.).  Any
 * ideas how I can determine the register size in a better (and portable)
 * fashion?
