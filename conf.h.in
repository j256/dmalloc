 * If this value is too low, the malloc-dbg library may think someone
 * is using sbrk behind its back and return a MALLOC_ALLOC_NONLINEAR

 * bits (where sizeof(long) == 8) because some system (like sparc for
 * instance) report the sizeof(long) == 4 while the register size is
 * 8 bytes.  Because of the register size, certain memory needs to be
 * base 8 (stack frames, code, etc.).
