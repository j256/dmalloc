HEAP OPERATIONS:

- realloc should look on either side (preferring above of course) for
	free bblocks and absorb them
	- find free section we can use
	- remove from free list(s)
	- rewrite admin chunks for used
	- rewrite admin chunks for left-overs (if there are any)
	- readd left-overs to free list (if there are any)
- when the last element in a dblock is freed, the block should be freed.
	- presents problems with maintaining the dblock-admin slots
	- probably requires a new pointer admin tree

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW HEAP ADMIN:
	- need skip-list module to maintain 2 trees:
		- bblocks: stores block info, allows free-joining
			- key: pnt
			- data:
				- flag (free/dblock/bblock)
				- size:
					- free: # bblocks
					- dblocks: # bits / # used in block
					- bblock: # bytes allocated
				- next-> (can we combine with something else?)
		- allocations: file, line, size
			- key: pnt
			- data:
				- (char *)file/ret-addr (or next->)
				- (short)line-number (0 if ret-addr)
				- (short)size: # dblock-bytes/bblocks
				- [pointer to bblock to go faster, ifdef]
				- [iteration # when allocated]
				- [iteration # when last touched]
				- [time when allocated]
				- [time when last touched]
				- [memory crc to track changes, need ~MD5]

	- time could be global or elapsed
		- always save start-time and dump it on shutdown if LOG_STAMP
		- ifdef the global or elapsed
		- ifdef the last-touched information
		- time info when LOG_STAMP
		- iteration information need a token: LOG_ITERATION
	- need to separate the allocations of the trees, different data sizes
	- either ignore the external bblocks and the ones for the tree
		allocations or account for them via careful recursion
	- still need free lists of bblocks/dblocks
	- maybe maintain the bblock free list (sorted by # blocks) in
		a skip-list for easy location, or walk free-list
	- with fence overruns, dump the pointer info on either side
		- easy with allocation tree
		- maybe have a #ifdef to define how many on either side
		- default 1

SKIP LISTS:
	- have free lists of the different #-of-pointers blocks
	- ask for 3-pointer block, check free lists, if not then go to
		last block of skip entries to see if there is space,
		if not then create new heap block and continue
	- maybe if ask for 3-pointer block, give 4-pointer and turn back
		into a 4-pointer after done, put ifdef for both and
		test for fragmentmentation

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

- comma separated tokens

	debug=0x40005c7
	addr=0x23412ab
	log=malloc
	inter=100
	start=file.c:100

- also have:
	- long and short options:
			log-stats,log-non-free,log-error,...
		or:
			lst,lnf,ler,...

- the dmalloc program would not change although you would have the
option of having it generate one of the three above formats.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHECKING:

- maybe have a type as the first argument to message
	- can be error,trans,admin,debug,etc.
	- this spits out a starting label to all messages:
		trans: checking heap
		admin: need 1 bblocks
- check in heap_check the cleared space above each allocation instead of
	only the fence posts
- maybe add another debug level which stores crc information about internal
	heap structures and verifies it during run time.  slow, slow!!
- maybe add crc information about each memory block into the admin
	structure and then be able to dump which blocks have changed
- maybe add 'use-mprotect' token to allow the user to access only
	user-allocated pages
- try and determine how purify gives the user per-allocation bounds
	checking on READS.
- watch for non-contiguous memory and mark those blocks as external
	- have some sort of EXTERNAL flag
	- make sure checked/freed/realloced/etc. pointers are not in that area
	- we may need to round sbrk() calls if someone else did not do a
		page-size call (see get_bblocks in chunk, need non-alloc flag)
- think of ways we can reorganize the heap and move allocations around
	since problems sometimes pop-up with different heap organizations:

	- pick a random slot from the free-list not just the first entry
	- add new list of dblocks in reverse order to the free-lists or
		randomly disperse
	- maybe when allocating for a block of X bits, get 2 blocks or
		some allocation factor
	- maybe some sort of compact heap orientation like ndt organization.
		- need a different dblock admin maintenance or
		- need to allocate max dblock-admin for every block
	- maybe generate some magical value which corresponds to the
		orientation because you want to be able to reproduce
		the error (bsd random?)
	- probably need an internal randomizer with log-able seed
		value and the ability to set the seed

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOCUMENTATION:

- add more to the debugging section:
	- use of MALLOC_START because a failure is found at some point
		to find the last malloc call
	- use of MALLOC_FUNC_CHECK by inserting dmalloc.h and FUNC_CHECK on

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TESTING / STATISTICS:

- maybe use the new gnu testing code
- general tons of small blocks and watch for dblock_admin entry leak
	like with large ndb_shell scripts
- maybe a program that would try a standard set of tests on a number of
	different combinations of debug-values to look for dependencies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL:

- maybe show the upper-end of a pointer if it is over fence post
	- need to pass size into log_error_info
- maybe with no 'log-unknown' token, don't print ANY info about
	non-file-line pnts
- maybe have some sort etext support for systems that don't have it?
	- etext (heap-start?)
	- end (heap-end?)
- maybe have some sort of memory-stack support:
	- malloc_push_location("foo");
	- malloc_pop_location("foo");
	- have a maximum ~100 entry stack
	- count how deep we are and if we go over don't store but track	so
		when we drop below 100 it will be correct info
	- if we are at an unknown spot, display the top of the stack
- maybe some sort of cheap crc on memory in non-freed memory sections so
	you can see what portions of memory changed (check tripwire)
- maybe provide support for reference counts on allocations:
	- have a call which along with malloc/realloc, increments the
		reference count of the node (maybe duplicate_pointer)
	- free will decrement the reference count and free if 0
	- have a call which reports on the reference count of the node
	- may need additional admin space
	- debug token?
- maybe have bit in allocation struct somewhere that it is a string and
	maybe have a checking level/value that runs though the strings
	and makes sure they have a NULL in them.
	- token 'check-string' or something
	- should only happen if alloc-blank used
	- could be dangerous if folks are changing 'type' of allocation
		from string to ...
- write perl script to summarize the memory usage per file.
- for fence underflow, print out the pointer below's info and for fence
	overflow the pointer above's info
- handle memalign, valloc, maybe some form of mallopt
	- maybe mallopt could be mapped into dmalloc_debug()

- maybe store the time and iteration count in the allocated structure
	for when dumping non-freed blocks list
- maybe add another time logging flag to dump the elapsed time since start

- maybe an environment variable to designate which program(s) you want to
	debug. found with strstr.
	- or could use .mallocrc entry
	- could have program:tag entries for default behavior in program
