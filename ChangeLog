Sat Sep 25 13:45:33 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Fixed up the messages to provide more information and to just
	reflect reality.  Some real dumb errors found.

	* Added malloc_debug_current() and #ifdef STDC instead of
	#if, via feedback from Scott Michel.

Wed Sep 22 00:43:54 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Removed log-bad-pnt.  What a dumb token!  Unnecessary!

Mon Sep 20 20:36:23 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Releasing version 1.3.3.

	* Added ALLOW_FREE_NULL defines because of some systems allowing
	free(0).  Yeach!  Via freeback from Dave Hill.

Fri Sep 10 17:10:45 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Fixed debug value changes in mid-stream.  Repaired configuration
	error with memcpy/bcopy and memcmp/bcmp via feedback from Marc
	Evans (?).

Tue Sep  7 00:49:50 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Renamed all error codes to ERROR_*.  Added ERROR_IS_FREE and
	changed some of the already-free errors to this.  Reworded some
	error messages and added free's file/line into to log_bad_pnt.

Mon Aug 30 17:23:47 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added prototypes for _malloc_strcpy, etc. functions to
	malloc_dbg.h per Scott's comments.

Thu Aug 26 19:06:45 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Releaced version 1.3.2.  Uploaded to the ftp site.

	* Removed MALLOC_TRACE and malloc_dbg -t.  Replaced by
	MALLOC_ADDRESS:0 functionality and logging of a message every time
	malloc_address is seen.

	* Fixed some dumb const problems.  Have to now preprocess
	malloc_dbg.h from start const.h end.  Yeach!

	* Added MALLOC_LOGFILE feature where %d in the string will be
	replaced with the pid of the process.  Had to add getpid to
	configure and compat.

	* Fixed some problems with compat.h defines.

Tue Aug 24 00:35:49 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Releasing version 1.3.1.

	* Added log-ra token to log specific information about non-freed
	memory with only return-address information.

	* Added the beginnings of return-address handling via feedback
	from Dave Hill.  Need to resolve some XXX sections in chunk and
	get more architecture/compiler hacks in return.h.  Along the way
	had to change the malloc_examine() arguments to add ret_attr.

	* Added -L or --list to malloc_dbg to list all the rc-file tags.

	* Fixed some problems in chunk.c via Dave Hill's feedback and
	renamed malloc_str.[ch] to be arg_check.[ch].

Tue Aug 17 16:22:20 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Releasing version 1.3.0.

	* Fixed some ansi compiler problems via patch from Manfred
	Hauswirth.

Thu Aug 12 18:11:01 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	tracing an address and logging messages about it.  NOTE: this
	was later removed -- replaced by MALLOC_ADDRESS:0.

Tue Aug 10 16:43:07 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Made some minor fixes via feedback from Marc Evans.

Mon Jul 26 05:50:27 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added smallest_block runtime calculations.

Mon Jul 19 12:20:58 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Made malloc_address exported per Dave Hill's comments so it
	can be setable by debugger at runtime.

	* Added Dave Hill's idea of auto-sensing of shell by malloc_dbg.
	Also added -C option to malloc_dbg to force cshell output.

	* Removed the dblock checking tokens CHECK_DBLOCK and
	CHECK_DB_FENCE for a couple different reasons.  I never liked them
	anyway!  I also renumbered CHECK_FREE and CHECK_FUNCS in the
	process.

	* Fixed a number of int/long problems since Dave Hill is running
	malloc on a 64 bit alpha.

	* Made a number of changes to the configure scripts and conf.h per
	Dave Hill's comments.  Added BASIC_BLOCK and ALLOCATION_ALIGNMENT
	to the auto-config stuff.

Fri Jul 16 00:01:31 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Changed malloc_dbg per new ARGV_MAYBE.  Made some various
	changes from ints to longs per some useful comments from Dave
	Hill.

Tue Jul 13 01:53:32 1993  Gray Watson  (gray@fridge.antaire.com)

	* Version 1.2.6 released.

	* Posting to bsdi.  Last minute porting changes.

	* Finished new catch-null token.

Tue Jul  6 16:04:17 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added 'catch-null' token for quiting as soon as we get a sbrk
	failure (i.e. the swap is full or something) as opposed to
	returning NULL.

Sat Jun 19 14:49:42 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Minor changes to configuration and notes files.

	* Fixed small malloc_dbg token bug from Peter Miller.

Thu Jun  3 16:01:14 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added index to manual, removed shar files in place of Makefile
	variables.

Mon May 24 12:58:06 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added -r and -k options for auto-unseting of variables or
	keeping of variables with malloc_dbg when setting a tag.

	* Added const checking to configure and reordered some include
	files to put conf.h on top.

Tue May 18 20:07:41 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added log-bad-space token and added expand_buf into chunk.c.

	* Create log_bad_pnt in chunk.  Probably broke stuff.
	Translated some flag to BIT_FLAG format.

	* Updated README and started ftp site thanks to Doug Balog.

Thu May 13 00:56:39 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Released version 1.2.4.

	* Pretty stable now for a while.  Trying to get access to a ftp
	for distribution ease.

Thu May  6 11:26:03 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added new fix-patch script for myself.  Fixed malloc_t by
	removing LOCAL/EXPORT, etc.

Fri Apr 30 15:26:12 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Removed some heap checks in malloc.c from Bali Jatinder's
	comments and fixed some of the error strings.

	* Moved around some defines and changes include ordering.

	* Added -v option to malloc_dbg to provide verbose output
	especially for dumping currently set debug tokens from
	MALLOC_DEBUG variable.

Mon Apr 19 16:04:17 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Released version 1.2.3.

	* Made some changes to a lot of comments, notes files, and ttd
	file.

Thu Apr 15 17:44:41 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Renamed malloc.h to malloc_dbg.h and libmalloc.a to
	libmalloc_dbg.a.  Added heap-extension checking and verification
	to make sure no-one extends the heap using sbrk behind out back.
	Fixed calloc to have the number of elements be a size_t to (WHY??
	It's not a size!!).  Fixed malloc_t free problems.

Wed Apr 14 18:11:00 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Released version 1.2.2.

	* Added some more point checking tests to malloc_str.  Added
	MALLOC_SIZE to some more places.  Completely ifdef'ed compat.h.
	If cannot open logfile, now it complains and continues.  Removed
	stdarg from malloc_dbg.

Fri Apr  9 01:50:17 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Released version 1.2.1.

	* Made various other changes.  Backed out some printf changes.
	Added SIZE_T defines and fixed up STDC defines.

Thu Apr  8 17:41:59 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Changed to void * internally from char * and put STDC defines in
	malloc.h for ANSI folks.  Why did the ANSI idiots drop the return
	value from free?  Dumb!

	* Made a number of changes per suggestions from the net.  Added
	some size_t defines for AIX junk (that's right Scott junk).  Cut
	down on the continuation strings, fixed some README and mallocrc
	goofs, etc.  Thanks to all.

Tue Apr  6 00:46:45 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Released version 1.2.0 to comp.sources.unix.

	* Upgraded to version 1.2.0.  Ready for 2nd release to
	comp.sources.unix.  Lots of work on the manual.

Mon Apr  5 18:28:05 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Finished adding token "check-funcs" to check the arguments of
	some common string functions to see whether they are in the heap.
	if so it tries to verify that the pointers are good.

Sun Apr  4 21:24:45 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added token "log-unknown" to dump non-free unknown pointers as
	well as known ones.  Also cleaned up the displaying of the
	pointers.

	* comp.sources.unix is almost ready to post so lots of last minute
	cleanups in the manual, etc.

	* Started integration of function argument checking.

Tue Mar 30 19:36:27 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Changed malloc.h defines so malloc routines are handled as well
	as the ALLOC macros.

	* malloc_dbg program now reports on the token NAME and values.

	* Added initial string files for string support in the future.

	* A number of minor changes: fixed gcc compilation problems per
	Scott's help, combined malloc_lp.h into malloc.h, cleaned most .h
	and .c files.

Fri Mar 26 04:00:14 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Fixed post 1.1.6 problem with chunk.c.  Boy do I need some
	automated testing tools.  Discovered the illusive localtime
	fence-post error.  Had a hard time tracking it down.  Maybe due to
	the fact that the checks were not being made on dblock fence posts
	before?

	* Released version 1.1.6

	* Found some problems with malloc debug codes.  Use of DB_FENCE
	and CHECK_LISTS and some others were improper.  A MALLOC_DEBUG
	value of 0x403000 would crash all malloc programs.  :-)

	* Added some better comments to all files and cleaned up most
	files too.

Fri Mar 12 18:35:02 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Released version 1.1.5.

Sat Feb 13 17:25:43 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Finished add a number of const operators to improve coding per
	scott's recommendations.

Sat Jan 30 12:33:43 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Released version 1.1.4

	* Took out the check_vars call inside of malloc_strerror since
	_malloc_perror calls malloc_strerror which would go quickly
	recursive.  Thanks scott.

Tue Jan  5 00:00:00 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Posted version 1.1.3 shar files to comp.sources.unix.

Sat Jan  2 00:16:58 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Made last minute changes to solve some gcc/ansi errors and
	to the manual to get things ready for the post.

Sun Dec 27 20:28:19 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Fixed problem with some external functions in malloc.c not
	reseting the in_alloc flag.  Also removed some testing of unsigned
	variables < 0 in chunk.c per gcc 2.3.3 warnings.

	* Released version 1.1.3.

Mon Dec 21 15:31:50 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Created the series of shar files in preparation to posting to
	comp.unix.sources.  Looking good.

Thu Dec 17 18:33:38 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Renamed a number of files to comply with the Sys5 12 character
	restrictions (14 - 2 for RCS/CVS/SCCS).  Yeach.  malloc_debug ->
	malloc_dbg.

Sat Nov 14 15:59:53 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added all external functions to configure and conf.h even though
	the library assumes that some functions will be resolved.  Also
	upgraded the version number to 1.01gamma (oooooh).

	* Added print-perror debug token for logging messages to STDERR as
	well as log-files.  Removed stdio from the malloc library to make
	sure it does not go recursive (alloc for stderr) at a bad time.

Wed Nov 11 18:19:49 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Moved the heap_check calls from chunk.c over to malloc so we can
	be guaranteed that it gets called only once per user call.
	chunk's routines often cross-call each other meaning that
	heap-check was being run 5 times be realloc.  YEACH!!

Tue Nov 10 17:55:53 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added two new debug-tokens: log-blocks and heap-check-map.  Also
	made sure that heap_check was being called from everywhere.
	Updated the manual and corresponding files.

	* Added library functions that may not be defined.  Updated the
	conf.h.in and configure.in files to improve confiurability.
	Upgraded the manual which still needs a lot of work (sigh).

Mon Nov  9 19:21:25 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added configure, configure.in, conf.h.in, and Makefile.in to try
	and conform with autoconf specs.  What a bear.  The documentation
	for autoconf needs a whole bunch more examples, etc.  Sigh.
	Removed all the MEMORY and STRING defines, etc.

Thu Nov  5 22:13:18 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Released version 1.01b.  Sending it off to some folks.

	* Lots and lots of changes.  Translated all programs into non-ansi
	C dependance and then went back again when I found some problems
	with my macros.  :-)  Took out all (and I mean all) Antaire
	dependancies and defines.

Thu Oct 22 00:47:18 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Ran through most of the debug-flag functionality testing and
	tweaking.  Found some bugs on dblock handling and some messed up
	logic with the way the LOG flags were working.

	* malloc_debug is looking good.  It now outputs C or Bourne shell
	code and seems to work in both environments.  What do sh folks use
	in the place of c-shell aliasing?  I guess use bash.  :-)

Wed Oct 21 03:27:35 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Major changes.  I sort of went overboard tonight.  I integrated
	the new malloc_debug program which sets all the debug variables
	for you.  I also added a .mallocrc which you can define with tags
	exactly the functionality you want to happen.  No more levels!!

	* Did some renaming of files, cleaned up some other things,
	had to rework a number of items to get new debug flags working.

Tue Oct 20 18:06:36 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Removed useful.h requirements and integrated necessary
	definitions into malloc.h.

	* Transfered malloc.txt documentation into malloc.texinfo.  Boy
	is it nifty!!  And damn easy!!!

	* Major changes to improve general machine independance.  Added
	malloc_mach.h.  Moved alloc.[ch] to malloc.[ch] for sanity
	reasons.

Tue Oct 13 16:14:17 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Made various cosmetic changes.  Fixed realloc inbound pointer
	checking per MALLOC_ADDRESS.  Fixed problem with MALLOC_ADDRESS
	initialization to NULL causing free to "find" NULL pointers.  :-)

	* Separated the PERROR debug level and the KILL_SELF level.  Now
	(by default) all memory errors are logged at level 1 and above and
	malloc kills itself at level 2 and above.

Mon Sep 28 23:24:36 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added MALLOC_ADDRESS support for free.  MALLOC_ADDRESS counts
	now also apply to frees also.

Mon Sep 21 20:39:38 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster)

	* Fixed some size problems with bounds checking enabled.

	* Made free be able to report who freed a pointer.  I don't know
	why this wasn't caught before.  free wasn't even using its
	file/line arguments.

Thu Sep  3 03:23:39 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster)

	* Added ability to realloc a NULL pointer with an ifdef to
	disable.  Useful in realloc loops where the first time you don't
	have to alloc it.

Fri Aug 14 15:54:03 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster)

	* Added a bunch of new environmental variables features:
	MALLOC_ADDRESS now can have a :# argument.  MALLOC_START now has
	two formats, the old number and new file:line.  Looks nice!

	* Made a pass through chunk.c and fixed a number of problems where
	debug output pnt/size did not match user-supplied information.

	* Moved most of the debug variables into alloc.c from chunk.c and
	added a standardizied check_debug_vars() checking routine.

Tue Jul 21 16:06:13 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster)

	* Fixed malloc count statistics.  Removed duplicate malloc_count
	varaibale from a number of places.

Mon Mar 23 10:49:25 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster)

	* Released version 0.04

	* New env variable features.

Thu Mar 12 19:28:34 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster)

	* Fixed a large problem with chunk.c not reporting the correct
	memory address when listing unfreed memory.  This was discovered
	when MALLOC_ADDRESS was not working correctly.
