Mon Apr 19 16:04:17 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Released version 1.2.3.

	* Made some changes to a lot of comments, notes files, and ttd
	file.

Thu Apr 15 17:44:41 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Renamed malloc.h to malloc_dbg.h and libmalloc.a to
	libmalloc_dbg.a.  Added heap-extension checking and verification
	to make sure no-one extends the heap using sbrk behind out back.
	Fixed calloc to have the number of elements be a size_t to (WHY??
	It's not a size!!).  Fixed malloc_t free problems.

Wed Apr 14 18:11:00 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Released version 1.2.2.

	* Added some more point checking tests to malloc_str.  Added
	MALLOC_SIZE to some more places.  Completely ifdef'ed compat.h.
	If cannot open logfile, now it complains and continues.  Removed
	stdarg from malloc_dbg.

Fri Apr  9 01:50:17 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Released version 1.2.1.

	* Made various other changes.  Backed out some printf changes.
	Added SIZE_T defines and fixed up STDC defines.

Thu Apr  8 17:41:59 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Changed to void * internally from char * and put STDC defines in
	malloc.h for ANSI folks.  Why did the ANSI idiots drop the return
	value from free?  Dumb!

	* Made a number of changes per suggestions from the net.  Added
	some size_t defines for AIX junk (that's right scott junk).  Cut
	down on the continuation strings, fixed some README and mallocrc
	goofs, etc.  Thanks to all.

Tue Apr  6 00:46:45 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* version 1.2.0 posted to comp.sources.unix.

	* Upgraded to version 1.2.0.  Ready for 2nd release to
	comp.sources.unix.  Lots of work on the manual.

Mon Apr  5 18:28:05 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Finished adding token "check-funcs" to check the arguments of
	some common string functions to see whether they are in the heap.
	if so it tries to verify that the pointers are good.

Sun Apr  4 21:24:45 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added token "log-unknown" to dump non-free unknown pointers as
	well as known ones.  Also cleaned up the displaying of the
	pointers.

	* comp.sources.unix is almost ready to post so lots of last minute
	cleanups in the manual, etc.

	* Started integration of function argument checking.

Tue Mar 30 19:36:27 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Changed malloc.h defines so malloc routines are handled as well
	as the ALLOC macros.

	* malloc_dbg program now reports on the token NAME and values.

	* Added initial string files for string support in the future.

	* A number of minor changes: fixed gcc compilation problems per
	scott's help, combined malloc_lp.h into malloc.h, cleaned most .h
	and .c files.

Fri Mar 26 04:00:14 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Fixed post 1.1.6 problem with chunk.c.  Boy do I need some
	automated testing tools.  Discovered the illusive localtime
	fence-post error.  Had a hard time tracking it down.  Maybe due to
	the fact that the checks were not being made on dblock fence posts
	before?

	* Upgraded to 1.1.6

	* Found some problems with malloc debug codes.  Use of DB_FENCE
	and CHECK_LISTS and some others were improper.  A MALLOC_DEBUG
	value of 0x403000 would crash all malloc programs.  :-)

	* Added some better comments to all files and cleaned up most
	files too.

Fri Mar 12 18:35:02 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Upgraded to 1.1.5.

Sat Feb 13 17:25:43 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Finished add a number of const operators to improve coding per
	scott's recommendations.

Sat Jan 30 12:33:43 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Took out the check_vars call inside of malloc_strerror since
	_malloc_perror calls malloc_strerror which would go quickly
	recursive.  Thanks scott.

	* Changed to version 1.1.4

Tue Jan  5 00:00:00 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Sent off 1.1.3 shar files to comp.sources.unix.

Sat Jan  2 00:16:58 1993  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Made last minute changes to solve some gcc/ansi errors and
	to the manual to get things ready for the post.

Sun Dec 27 20:28:19 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Fixed problem with some external functions in malloc.c not
	reseting the in_alloc flag.  Also removed some testing of unsigned
	variables < 0 in chunk.c per gcc 2.3.3 warnings.

	* Changed version to 1.1.3.

Mon Dec 21 15:31:50 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Created the series of shar files in preparation to posting to
	comp.unix.sources.  Looking good.

Thu Dec 17 18:33:38 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Renamed a number of files to comply with the Sys5 12 character
	restrictions (14 - 2 for RCS/CVS/SCCS).  Yeach.  malloc_debug ->
	malloc_dbg.

Sat Nov 14 15:59:53 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added all external functions to configure and conf.h even though
	the library assumes that some functions will be resolved.  Also
	upgraded the version number to 1.01gamma (oooooh).

	* Added print-perror debug token for logging messages to STDERR as
	well as log-files.  Removed stdio from the malloc library to make
	sure it does not go recursive (alloc for stderr) at a bad time.

Wed Nov 11 18:19:49 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Moved the heap_check calls from chunk.c over to malloc so we can
	be guaranteed that it gets called only once per user call.
	chunk's routines often cross-call each other meaning that
	heap-check was being run 5 times be realloc.  YEACH!!

Tue Nov 10 17:55:53 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added two new debug-tokens: log-blocks and heap-check-map.  Also
	made sure that heap_check was being called from everywhere.
	Updated the manual and corresponding files.

	* Added library functions that may not be defined.  Updated the
	conf.h.in and configure.in files to improve confiurability.
	Upgraded the manual which still needs a lot of work (sigh).

Mon Nov  9 19:21:25 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added configure, configure.in, conf.h.in, and Makefile.in to try
	and conform with autoconf specs.  What a bear.  The documentation
	for autoconf needs a whole bunch more examples, etc.  Sigh.
	Removed all the MEMORY and STRING defines, etc.

Thu Nov  5 22:13:18 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Released version 1.01b.  Sending it off to some folks.

	* Lots and lots of changes.  Translated all programs into non-ansi
	C dependance and then went back again when I found some problems
	with my macros.  :-)  Took out all (and I mean all) Antaire
	dependancies and defines.

Thu Oct 22 00:47:18 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Ran through most of the debug-flag functionality testing and
	tweaking.  Found some bugs on dblock handling and some messed up
	logic with the way the LOG flags were working.

	* malloc_debug is looking good.  It now outputs C or Bourne shell
	code and seems to work in both environments.  What do sh folks use
	in the place of c-shell aliasing?  I guess use bash.  :-)

Wed Oct 21 03:27:35 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Major changes.  I sort of went overboard tonight.  I integrated
	the new malloc_debug program which sets all the debug variables
	for you.  I also added a .mallocrc which you can define with tags
	exactly the functionality you want to happen.  No more levels!!

	* Did some renaming of files, cleaned up some other things,
	had to rework a number of items to get new debug flags working.

Tue Oct 20 18:06:36 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Removed useful.h requirements and integrated necessary
	definitions into malloc.h.

	* Transfered malloc.txt documentation into malloc.texinfo.  Boy
	is it nifty!!  And damn easy!!!

	* Major changes to improve general machine independance.  Added
	malloc_mach.h.  Moved alloc.[ch] to malloc.[ch] for sanity
	reasons.

Tue Oct 13 16:14:17 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Made various cosmetic changes.  Fixed realloc inbound pointer
	checking per MALLOC_ADDRESS.  Fixed problem with MALLOC_ADDRESS
	initialization to NULL causing free to "find" NULL pointers.  :-)

	* Separated the PERROR debug level and the KILL_SELF level.  Now
	(by default) all memory errors are logged at level 1 and above and
	malloc kills itself at level 2 and above.

Mon Sep 28 23:24:36 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster.antaire.com)

	* Added MALLOC_ADDRESS support for free.  MALLOC_ADDRESS counts
	now also apply to frees also.

Mon Sep 21 20:39:38 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster)

	* Fixed some size problems with bounds checking enabled.

	* Made free be able to report who freed a pointer.  I don't know
	why this wasn't caught before.  free wasn't even using its
	file/line arguments.

Thu Sep  3 03:23:39 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster)

	* Added ability to realloc a NULL pointer with an ifdef to
	disable.  Useful in realloc loops where the first time you don't
	have to alloc it.

Fri Aug 14 15:54:03 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster)

	* Added a bunch of new environmental variables features:
	MALLOC_ADDRESS now can have a :# argument.  MALLOC_START now has
	two formats, the old number and new file:line.  Looks nice!

	* Made a pass through chunk.c and fixed a number of problems where
	debug output pnt/size did not match user-supplied information.

	* Moved most of the debug variables into alloc.c from chunk.c and
	added a standardizied check_debug_vars() checking routine.

Tue Jul 21 16:06:13 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster)

	* Fixed malloc count statistics.  Removed duplicate malloc_count
	varaibale from a number of places.

Mon Mar 23 10:49:25 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster)

	* Released version 0.04 with new env variable features.

Thu Mar 12 19:28:34 1992  Gray Watson  (gray at toaster)

	* Fixed a large problem with chunk.c not reporting the correct
	memory address when listing unfreed memory.  This was discovered
	when MALLOC_ADDRESS was not working correctly.
