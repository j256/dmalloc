3) Update the version numbers in the following files:
	Changlog
	README.md
	configure.ac (in AC_INIT)
	dmalloc.spec
	dmalloc.texi
4) Update doc files: make docs
5) Consider updating the copyright heads in all files and in chunk.c strings.
6) Check in all files.
7) Run tests:
	- [ maybe mkdir x ; cd x ]
	- ./configure or ../configure
	- make all heavy
	- maybe install the new dmalloc utility to test
	- dmalloc -l malloc high
	- make heavy
	- examine the log file, check version, look for exceptions
	- [ maybe dmalloc_t -r ] to check for wierd flag conditions
8) Clone on linux and others and run tests: git clone git@github.com:j256/dmalloc.git
9) Run release.sh script.  It will run tests on repo.
11) git tag the release:
