# Sample Malloc rc file for the debug malloc library
# Rename this to .mallocrc and place in your home directory to activate.

# This file maps tags to certain combinations of tokens.  The tags here
# are only provided as an example.  You are supposed to roll your own.
# Lines in this file should have the form:
#
#	tag	token1, token2, ...
#
# To use the above line you say 'malloc_dbg tag' which enables the debugging
# facilities token1, token2, ...  You must pass the output from malloc_dbg
# through your shell's eval command to change your environment.  Se
# malloc.info for more information.
#
# Lines can be finished with a \ meaning it continues onto the next line.
# Lines begining with '#' or empty lines are ignored

# log-unknown			log unknown non-freed memory pointers too
# log-bad-space			log some memory from the bad pointers
#
# check-fence			check fence-post areas
# check-heap			do general heap checking
# check-lists			verify internal heap linked-lists
# check-dblock			do detailed checking on small allocations
# check-dblock-fence		check the fence-post areas of small allocations
# check-free			check to see if free space has been overwritten
# check-funcs			check the arguments of some routines
#
# alloc-blank			overwrite space that is to be alloced
# error-abort			abort the program (and dump core) on errors
# catch-null			abort program if library can't get sbrk space
# free-blank			overwrite space that is freed
# heap-check-map		log a heap-map every time the heap is checked
# print-perror			dump errors and messages to STDERR
# realloc-copy			always copy data to a new pointer when realloc
