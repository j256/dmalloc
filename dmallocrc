# Sample Malloc rc file for the debug malloc library
# Rename this to .mallocrc and place in your home directory to activate.
# See malloc.info for more information

# Lines in this file should have the form:
#
#	tag	token1, token2, ...
#
# The above 'tag' is then passed to the 'malloc' alias to set the current
# debugging functionality to token1, token2, ...
#
# Tag lines can be finished with a \ meaning it continues onto the next line.
# Lines begining with '#' or empty lines are ignored
#

# none				no debuging functionality
#
# log-stats			log general statistics
# log-non-free			log non-freed memory pointers on shutdown
# log-perror			log error codes and messages
# log-trans			log memory transactions
# log-bad-pnt			log information about bad-pointers
# log-admin			log full administrative information
# log-blocks			log detailed block information in heap_map
# log-unknown			log unknown non-freed memory pointers too
#
# check-fence			check fence-post areas
# check-heap			do general heap checking
# check-lists			verify internal heap linked-lists
# check-dblock			do detailed checking on small allocations
# check-dblock-fence		check the fence-post areas of small allocations
# check-free			check to see if free space has been overwritten
# check-funcs			check the arguments of some routines
#
# realloc-copy			always copy data to a new pointer when realloc
# free-blank			overwrite space that is freed
# error-abort			abort the program (and dump core) on errors
# alloc-blank			overwrite space that is to be alloced
# heap-check-map		log a heap-map every time the heap is checked
# print-perror			dump errors and messages to STDERR
