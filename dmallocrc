# activate.  See malloc.info for more information.

# This file maps tags to certain combinations of tokens.  The tags
# here are only provided as an example.  You are supposed to roll your
# own.  Lines in this file should have the form:
#
#	tag	token1, token2, ...
#
# To use the above line you say 'dmalloc tag' which enables the
# debugging facilities token1, token2, ...  You must pass the output
# from dmalloc through your shell's eval command to change your
# environment.  See malloc.info for more information.
#
# Lines can end with a \ meaning it continues onto the next line.
# Lines beginning with '#' or empty lines are ignored
